## About Me

I am **Han Hu**, Chinese 胡晗, a final year PhD student at Monash University, Australia.  
My research primarily focuses on **mobile application (app) analysis**, including **static program analysis**, **cross-platform (Android, iOS) app analysis**, **dynamic GUI analysis**, and developing **AI** & **Large Language Model (LLM)**--assisted approaches to enhance existing program analysis approaches for mobile apps.  
Key projects include the **cross-platform GUI adaptation and exploration** \[TOSEM'2024, NeurIPS'2023, TOSEM'2023\] and the **analysis of vulnerabilities in on-device models** \[TOSEM'2023, WWW'2022, ICSE'2021\].  
I am also actively engaged in **code generation** \[[Starcoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2), TOSEM'2021, ICONIP'2019\].


Fell free to drop me an email: han.hu@monash.edu, agmaiofhuhan@gmail.com if you would like to talk to me. 


## Job Market

I am on the job market now, actively looking for a **research scientist** or **postdoc position** in app analysis, LLM and related fields. I'm very interested in industrial-driven projects and am less concerned with top-tier publications. Although I am engaged in research, I am very confident in my coding and communication skills.

## Recent Work

Expanding my research scope, I now focus on the analysis of vulnerabilities inherent in on-device DL models and the assessment of the reliability of the outputs generated by these models. This endeavor encompasses a comprehensive examination of deployed models and their corresponding codes in apps, as well as the development of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating the outputs of such models.

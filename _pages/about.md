## About Me

I am **Han Hu**, Chinese 胡晗, a final-year PhD student at Monash University, Australia, with my main PhD supervisor being Prof. Chunyang Chen@TUM. \
My research primarily focuses on **mobile application analysis**, including **static program analysis**, **cross-platform (Android, iOS) app analysis**, **dynamic GUI analysis**, and developing **AI** & **Large Language Model (LLM)**--assisted approaches to enhance existing program analysis approaches for mobile apps.  
Key projects include the **cross-platform GUI adaptation and exploration** \[TOSEM'2024, NeurIPS'2023, TOSEM'2023\] and the **analysis of vulnerabilities in on-device models** \[TOSEM'2023, WWW'2022, ICSE'2021\]. I am also actively engaged in **benchmark construction of LLMs**, focusing on tasks such as code generation and code comment generation \[[Starcoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2), TOSEM'2021, ICONIP'2019\].

Fell free to drop me an email: han.hu@monash.edu, agmaiofhuhan@gmail.com if you would like to talk to me. 


## Actively Seeking Full-time Employment

I am currently on the job market, actively pursuing opportunities as a **Research Scientist**, **Research Engineer** or **Postdoc**. My expertise centers around Code Generation, App Analysis, establishing LLM benchmarks and datasets, and LLM-driven product development, among other related areas.
I have a strong inclination towards industry-driven projects and roles that emphasize practical applications beyond solely contributing top-tier publications. While I am deeply involved in research, I am very confident in my coding and communication skills. Before starting my PhD, I accumulated one year of full-time work experience as a Researcher & Developer in industry.

If there is an opening in your team that aligns with my skills, please feel free to contact me to arrange an interview.

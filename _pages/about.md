## About Me

I am **Han Hu**, Chinese 胡晗, a final year PhD student at Monash University, Australia.  
My research primarily focuses on **mobile application analysis**, including **static program analysis**, **cross-platform (Android, iOS) app analysis**, **dynamic GUI analysis**, and developing **AI** & **Large Language Model (LLM)**--assisted approaches to enhance existing program analysis approaches for mobile apps.  
Key projects include the **cross-platform GUI adaptation and exploration** \[TOSEM'2024, NeurIPS'2023, TOSEM'2023\] and the **analysis of vulnerabilities in on-device models** \[TOSEM'2023, WWW'2022, ICSE'2021\]. I am also actively engaged in **benchmark construction of LLMs**, focusing on tasks such as code generation and code comment generation \[[Starcoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2), TOSEM'2021, ICONIP'2019\].

Fell free to drop me an email: han.hu@monash.edu, agmaiofhuhan@gmail.com if you would like to talk to me. 


## Actively Seeking Full-time Employment

I am on the job market now, actively seeking positions as a **Research Scientist**, **Research Engineer** or **Postdoc**. My areas of interest include Code Generation, App Analysis, the establishment of LLM benchmarks and datasets, LLM-driven product development or related fields.
I am particularly drawn to industry-driven projects and positions in industry that prioritize practical applications over solely contributing top-tier publications. While I am deeply involved in research, I am very confident in my coding and communication skills. Before starting my PhD, I accumulated one year of full-time work experience as a Researcher & Developer in industry.


## Latest News
